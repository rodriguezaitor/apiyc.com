We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.\r\n\r\nAs an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our \"Marketing Budget\" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\r\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.\r\n\r\nOur granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:\r\n    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor\r\n    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)\r\n    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)\r\n    - added coverage for mold removal\r\n\r\nOur MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, \"renting\" capacity as we need it.\r\n\r\nAll this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors.

      "description": "Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients\u2019 specific cancers. That\u2019s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\r\n\r\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don\u2019t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can\u2019t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\r\n\r\nOncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\r\n\r\nWe actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. \r\n\r\nOur team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",

      "description": "We build engines that have the potential to slash 33% or worldwide CO2 emissions - cost-effectively.\r\n\r\nFirst, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000\u00b0F.\r\n\r\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\r\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. \r\n\r\nWe design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.\r\n\r\nToday, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. \r\n\r\nOur cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.  \r\n\r\nWhat you work on at Pyka makes people\u2019s lives better now and brings the future of electric aviation one step closer each day. \r\n",

In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycles and high barriers to entry, we\u2019ve sold thousands of schools without a single sales person. We\u2019re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re now moving on to all the other questions children have that they\u2019ll never learn in school. In the last 18 months we received over 500,000 questions from children eager for better explanations of the world.  Now we\u2019re creating video explanations for every question. You can think of this like a visual Wikipedia for kids.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create a generation of better thinkers. We think this is the most important problem to solve in the world today.",

And what we\u2019ve managed to achieve so far only reaffirms our belief. \r\n\r\nNextDrop was founded in 2011 with a pilot in Hubli-Dharwad district of Karnataka. Four years later, we have 70,000 users registered with us across Karnataka. Our vision is simple- we want to link the private sector, government utilities and citizens to create an endless loop of timely service provision and feedback collection, and bridge all the gaps in between. And to do this, we try to harness the latest, cutting edge technology. \r\n\r\nWater is our mission. Data is our business. NextDrop crowdsources water data and creates algorithms and visualizations to improve urban water distribution across emerging markets. Urban residents can get a text message an hour before water arrives, if water supply is cancelled, or if there is contamination or low pressure present in the pipe network. On the utility side, engineers get a live feed on problems arising in the distribution system, so they can tackle issues in real time.",
