It\u2019s an excellent, cost effective way to commute, used by hundreds of thousands of Americans, but the industry is largely offline. It\u2019s difficult to find, join, and start vanpools. \r\n\r\nWe build software that fixes this, making vanpooling simple and flexible. We believe that in a post Covid world, it will be more important than ever to rethink shared transportation and make it more adaptive.\r\n\r\nOur customers are organizations like transit agencies and employers who have existing vanpool fleets. We provide these customers with our SaaS platform that manages their vanpool programs. We capture real time information about open seats, then make those seats available to book through our app. We also make it easy for people to crowdsource and start new vanpools.",

With Copia, partnering businesses can seamlessly access significant tax savings, dramatically reduce food waste through data and analytics on surplus, and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all while feeding their community.\r\n\r\nWe have diverted over 7M pounds of edible food from landfills and provided businesses and nonprofits with over $23M in savings.
