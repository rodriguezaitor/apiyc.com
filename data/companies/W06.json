      "description": "Wufoo is a web application that helps anybody build amazing online forms. When you design a form with Wufoo, it automatically builds the database, backend and scripts needed to make collecting and understanding your data easy, fast and fun. No coding required! \r\n\r\nFounded in 2006, Wufoo was created by Chris Campbell, Kevin Hale and Ryan Campbell on the belief that forms were the starting point for building anything useful on the web. The problem they saw was that one of the most efficient and used interfaces for collecting data, wasn\u2019t very efficient to create. So they decide to fix that by creating Wufoo!\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Wufoo was acquired by SurveyMonkey, the leader in web-based survey solutions, to help complement their growing suite of services to offer amazing data collections tools to their customers.",
