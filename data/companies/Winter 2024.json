We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Their proprietary delivery vehicles are designed using non-immunogenic proteins equipped with a targeting receptor, achieving targeted tropism to organs of interest. These vehicles offer higher stability than conventional lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and can encompass a variety of cargo, including proteins, DNA, and RNA.  \r\n\r\nFor their lead candidate, Granza Bio is leveraging the discovery of the immune system's powerful suite of weapons, \"attack particles\". Utilizing their advanced delivery platform, they aim to target these \"attack particles\" against a range of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections.   \r\n \r\nInterested to know more?

      "description": "DraftAid is the world's first generative AI for CAD manufacturing drawings, akin to GitHub Copilot but for CAD. It drastically shortens drawing creation time, turning hours into seconds.\r\n\r\nEvery product that is manufactured - from construction to aerospace, automotive, durable goods, and electronics\u2014relies on drawings. Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality. \r\n\r\nThe idea was born out of Abdullah's experience as a mechanical design team member, where he created thousands of drawings and longed for a more efficient process. Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

We help professionals get thorough answers to questions about clinical trials, existing treatments, healthcare landscape, and the competitive market in minutes rather than months. \r\n\r\nPrior to starting Argon, Samy was responsible for Flatiron Health\u2019s (Roche) first data analytics project which eventually led to the start of the Flatiron Services business unit. There, he saw first-hand the heavily manual process that biopharma companies struggle through to get the insights they need to drive forward their drug development programs. He also helped close over $6M+ in ARR and is an expert in enterprise pharma sales.\r\n\r\nCyrus previously led engineering teams and built 0 to 1 across pre-seed and unicorn startups, managed mission-critical trade generation systems at Bridgewater, and held AI advisory roles at various startups. Cyrus has a duel degree in EE and CS from USC.\r\n\r\nBreakthroughs in AI present an opportunity to reinvent biopharma and life science workflows to reduce the time and cost of bringing treatments to patients where delays in bringing a drug to market can cost a pharma company $3M / day.",
