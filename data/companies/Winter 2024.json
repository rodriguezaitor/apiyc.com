We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Our app lets users easily log their symptoms, diet, and treatments, then uses clinical indices to track disease severity and trends over time. Aidy excels at identifying patterns between diet, treatment adherence, and symptoms, giving our users a much more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of their condition to supplement clinician care. \r\n\r\nPreviously in our careers, both Max and Peter worked in health in different capacities. At the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Senate, Max worked in public health policy and COVID-19 response, while Peter worked as an ML researcher for a number of biotech companies. After a lengthy \u201cpivot hell\u201d we decided to finally listen to a friend with IBD who insisted that there weren\u2019t any decent apps to help people live with the disease. Pretty quickly, we discovered how LLMs and regular structured questionnaire responses could provide a level of patient empowerment not possible before for chronic diseases. From there, Aidy was (re)born!",

      "description": "Ego AI is building Character AI + Roblox. Our conviction is that 3D embodiment, shared activities in games and AI imbued with human-like personalities will solve the existing problems of low-stakes, shallow and generic interactions that impact retention in consumer AI chat experiences.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re fine-tuning a foundation model for characters to behave in human-like ways\u2014indistinguishable from real people\u2014and building a UGC platform around it to allow users to create, experience and form meaningful connections & mutual stories with these AI characters. On our platform, simworld,\u00a0users will be able place the characters in a Stardew Valley style simulated town, where the AI characters will live, work and play, leading rich internal lives. Users who deepen bonds with these AI character friends can invite them out with them to Discord, Minecraft or even a Netflix-n-chill session.\r\n\r\nOur Character engine, ego AI, built on top of Unreal, will allow users to create, deploy and even monetize their characters across any surface that supports our CCProtocol. The first use case for our characters will likely be DnD-style roleplay, Minecraft RP, and Twitch streaming. \r\n\r\nCharacters will always live and exist in Simtowns with other AIs (and humans) where they will all lead varied internal lives replete with conflict, danger, opportunity, and love\u2026just like humans in the real world!\r\n\r\nDuring YC, we used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld). To the best of our knowledge, it's the first ever AI 3D simulation of a small town in real time\r\n\r\nYC Launch - https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/KeD-ego-an-ai-native-3d-simulation-engine-getting-us-closer-to-the-matrix-one-pixel-at-a-time\r\n\r\nDemo video: https://docsend.com/view/mzf6i7kiwkkgg669\r\n\r\nAI 3D TownWorld video: https://docsend.com/view/ig6t2shuz26z7wha",
