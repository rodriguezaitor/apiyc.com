Saree blouses have to be tailor-made always due to their fitted nature & the non-stretchiness of typical Indian fabrics. \r\n\r\nThe tailoring market however, hasn't evolved at all. It is highly fragmented with a low NPS. The end user experience demands a significant amount of the customer's time, involving visits to a physical shop & avoidable back & forth. This is increasingly unviable for busy urban Indian women. We make it super easy by letting women place an order online, get fitted at the comfort of their homes, help them with styling their fabric & deliver the made-to-measure clothes directly to their doorstep.",

As attention spans shrink to six seconds, brands can't afford lifeless popups, forms, or landing pages. We replace them with gamified conversion layers\u2014quizzes, swipe games, stackers\u2014that perform like performance marketing.\r\n\r\nAt Unity, our founding team helped personalize gameplay and ads for over 2 billion users. Now, we're bringing that behavioral insight to brand engagement, building a no-code platform where anyone can launch PlayAbly experiences in minutes. Think: instead of a \"Spin to Win,\" a match-3 game that sells your product, segments your audience, and gets 4\u00d7 the opt-ins.\r\n\r\nWhy now? Retargeting costs are up. Email/SMS open rates are down. And today\u2019s customers are conditioned by the dopamine loops of TikTok and mobile games. Generic funnels can\u2019t compete\u2014but interactive ones can.\r\n\r\nPlayAbly is already driving results:\r\n\r\nClasskick (B2B): 5\u00d7 ROI, 3\u00d7 higher email open rates\r\n\r\nSkout Snacks (DTC): 7\u00d7 ROI, 20% higher AOV, 4\u00d7 opt-in rates\r\n\r\n89% of previously lost sessions re-engaged through PlayAbly games\r\n\r\nWe monetize on a usage + performance model, enabling fast adoption and deep long-term value.

      "description": "**TL;DR:** \r\n\r\nLegacy (YC S19) is a startup focused on the fast-growing field of fertility and family planning. Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised $40M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. \r\n\r\n**What we're doing**\r\n\r\nWe aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a \"women's issue\" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why are we the leader?** \r\n\r\nThe company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:\r\n\r\n1. Nationwide insurance coverage (10M+ lives)\r\n2. Military contracts (Including the Navy SEALs and 15M+ veterans)\r\n3. Employer offerings (Working with the top fertility benefit providers)\r\n\r\n**Tell me about the team** \r\n\r\nWe're a team of about 30, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning. \r\n\r\nLearn more about our values here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/legacys-values-and-why-they-matter-db116539d3da\r\n\r\nLearn more about our workplace here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nRead about our mission to humanize the path to parenthood:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nLearn more about sperm and why it matters here:\r\ndocsend.com/view/zkgk7ws",

BODYSIM is an app-based simulation of your body and its potential that recommends nutrition and exercise to meet your goals. Use BODYSIM to (1) Assemble your data from food logging, BIA weigh-ins, DEXA scans, at-home blood tests, and wearables, (2) Learn to \u201ctriangulate the truth\u201d of your unique metabolism and physiology, and (3) Adjust your nutrition and exercise plans by simulating what will happen to your body. One founder put on 45 lbs muscle, and another put on 25 lbs of muscle while losing 50 lbs of fat. Our alpha testers lost an average of 12.6 pounds in 3 months.\r\n\r\nOur core technology distills messy academic literature into simulations. Before turning to our own fitness journeys, we successfully deployed sophisticated enterprise models of plant-soil-atmosphere, consumer behavior and battery electrochemistry. With BODYSIM we built a science-based simulation of macronutrient balance and muscle hypertrophy. It includes cell turnover, oxidation for energy, lipolysis of fat stores, synthesis of new muscle, glycogen resynthesis, GI latency, and even ketones. Get jacked at BODYSIM.com\r\n",

Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures.\r\n\r\nInvestors can browse a variety of individual real estate properties ranging from commercial strip malls, a HELOC in someone's house, Airbnbs, to a single-family rental properties, and directly purchase ownership in these properties in under 5 minutes. There is no lockup period. Users can constantly trade these ownerships with others on the marketplace.\r\n\r\nInvestors truly legally own the properties they invested in and co-manage it with other investors through an online governance program. Owners have so far voted on how to handle various repairs, delinquent tenants, the sale of the underlying property, and much more.\r\n\r\nLofty never custodies or handles user funds or assets. Through smart-contracts on the blockchain, all transactions are directly peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed, we'll have built the NASDAQ for real estate and transformed how real estate is bought and sold in the USA.",

Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  \r\n\r\nI built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that\u2019s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you\u2019re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn\u2019t otherwise remember.\r\n",

Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally \"bringing the gas stations to doorsteps\". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.\r\n\r\nDo we have domain expertise in this area? \r\nFounder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.\r\n\r\nHow do you know people need what you're making? \r\nWe have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand.",

      "description": "EncepHeal is developing medications to treat substance abuse. Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.\r\n\r\nOur small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. \r\n\r\nOur management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.\r\n\r\nOur team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Pippin is building the autonomous homebuilding factory for the $1.7 trillion housing crisis. \r\n\r\nBuilding a home requires human labor to: measure, cut, lift, drill, paint, and attach. This labor is used for a building\u2019s: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans. Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.\r\n\r\nBuilding technology, methods, and materials have advanced and the constraints limiting home manufacturing can now be removed. Regulations have changed to allow small and simple accessory dwelling units (a.k.a. ADUs or backyard homes), making it easier to mass-produce housing. Pippin started in the ADU market with its brand \"Rent the Backyard\" and will build duplexes, quadplexes, and eventually large apartment buildings.",
