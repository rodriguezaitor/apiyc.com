      "description": "Hum is a product designed to disrupt email with collaboration. It organizes conversation into threads, lets you drop work requests into each others\u2019 feeds, and syncs everything across your devices. Hum is focused on real-time conversation and presence.\n\nIt makes it easy to see who else is currently viewing a thread. You can \u201cread later\u201d any threads you can\u2019t get to right now, or pin important conversations to the top of the app. The company made a lot of bold claims about how it will transition you away from email as you use it more, but didn\u2019t provide many specifics. Hum will have a steep uphill battle against incumbents like Yammer and Asana, and email, which has been harder to disrupt than most people realize.",
