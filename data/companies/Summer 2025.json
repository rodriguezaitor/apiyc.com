As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like \u201cmake it green and put it in the top right corner\u201d, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we\u2019re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications.

We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.\r\n\r\nBulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 30 to 50%. Without accurate numbers, it\u2019s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America.

Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 2025. Guests don\u2019t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 \u2014 taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant \u2014 the employee they\u2019ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family\u2019s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- \u201cCertus changed my life overnight.\u201d\r\n- \u201cWe were losing the ability to give great in-house service \u2014 the phone was killing us.\u201d\r\n-  \u201c70% of my business comes through the phone. That\u2019s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.\u201d\r\n- \u201cBefore Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day\u2026. now my printer just stays printing!\u201d\r\n-  \u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 38 years. I\u2019ve been waiting for this since then.\u201d\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem \u2014 one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we\u2019re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

We deploy AI agents to automate every step of the referral process that back-office staff face daily, from submitting prior authorizations to broadcasting updates and following up with patients. This frees up staff to focus on patient care.\r\n\r\nPrimary care back-offices are severely understaffed and overburdened by administrative work associated with referrals. Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don\u2019t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system\u2014where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta\u2019s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",

Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26:\r\n\u2022 Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can\u2019t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued.

      "description": "Floot lets non-coders & entrepreneurs build real web apps that actually work. We\u2019re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.\r\n\r\n\u2728 Try building an app at floot.com\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don\u2019t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling.

Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our self-guided missile platform is man-portable and multi-domain capable. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement over existing kinetic solutions. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued their PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nJason and Steve used more than 100 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. In 8 short weeks following a strict 2-week design-build-test cycle, the team has gone through 4 major guided missile iterations with over 30 live-fire flight tests. They were invited to Ft. Hood to present their platform to the 1st Cavalry Division, and also briefed the Pentagon and U.S. congressmen on current U.S. vulnerabilities to advanced drone technology.  Perseus Defense is actively standing up cooperative research agreements with U.S. Army DEVCOM's Applied Research Laboratory, Aviation and Missile Center, Armaments Center, and High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",

Worse yet: \r\n+ it\u2019s often impossible to get enough data for a specific task, and \r\n+ even the best cv models struggle to generalize across diverse camera setups, workflows and environments. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these blockers, we bet early on the power of VLMs and built a vision engine that can generalize across any task and doesn\u2019t need any training data. We published a NeurIPS workshop paper showing our new methods with VLMs beat traditional CV even at niche tasks.\r\n\r\nOur current customers include:\r\n- National Defense Organizations\r\n- Robotics Research\r\n- Security cameras\r\n- Behaviour analysis for port monitoring\r\n- Off-shore oil & gas monitoring",

A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

Simple tasks often require desktop based software and coding expertise. Most platforms rely on outdated desktop software, steep learning curves, and disconnected tools. Even simple tasks like uploading data, running a buffer, or visualizing zones can take hours and require specialists.\r\n\r\nMonarcha changes that.\r\nWe connect directly to your data, enrich it with public datasets, understand spatial context, and let you run 50+ spatial tools instantly on the map. Upload vector or raster files, run PostGIS SQL queries, generate heatmaps, clip zones, and more all with a simple prompt. We're giving everyone the power of advanced spatial analysis to help save time, money and unlock siloed geospatial data across entire organizations. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more?
