They cannot message your friends on Messenger, send money on Venmo, or compare ride-share prices to book the best option.\r\n\r\nBlue can do all of this and more.\r\n\r\nIt taps, swipes, and types like a human on both Android and iPhone, so it doesn't need any app-specific integrations. This is made possible through a voice-first computer-use model as well as a custom hardware. \r\n\r\nIt already works in the real world. Users are texting, shopping, and navigating their phones completely hands-free. People who are commuting, cooking, or multitasking are using Blue to reclaim meaningful time during their day.\r\n\r\nOur team brings rare and highly complementary experience. Omar led Google Assistant\u2019s transition to LLMs and holds one of the earliest patents in LLM-based computer control. Peter brings decades of experience designing and building voice-first dialog systems, holds multiple design patents, and was most recently the design lead at Google DeepMind serving actions on the Gemini Live model. Farhan helped ship Apple\u2019s Vision Pro and holds more than 50 patents in hardware and systems design. He's also led several products end-to-end from early prototyping to mass production and global fulfillment.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have built systems used by billions of people and are now building something even more fundamental: re-inventing the way we use and interact with technology.",

We did a massive amount of work on our previous platforms that was not specific to our product, and we\u2019ve created Modelence to abstract that away:\r\n- Authentication\r\n- Database setup\r\n- Hosting / CDN\r\n- AI integration (LLM observability, prompts)\r\n- Real-time events\r\n- Cron jobs\r\n- Email service\r\n- Monitoring\r\n- Analytics\r\n- Admin dashboards\r\n\r\nAndrej Karpathy recently posted about this same exact problem:\r\nhttps://x.com/karpathy/status/1905051558783418370\r\n\r\nand explained it further in his YC AI Startup School talk:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?feature=shared&t=1940",

      "description": "Magnetic scans client documents - from handwritten charity notes to excel spreadsheet Schedule Cs to multi-state K-1s - and enters them into tax software automatically, saving hours of tedious data entry. \r\n\r\nThe accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

      "description": "Certus AI is replacing the restaurant phone line with Voice AI.\r\n\r\nRestaurants lose up to $100,000 per year per location from missed calls, lost orders, and abandoned hold lines. Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 2025. Guests don\u2019t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 \u2014 taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant \u2014 the employee they\u2019ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family\u2019s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- \u201cCertus changed my life overnight.\u201d\r\n- \u201cWe were losing the ability to give great in-house service \u2014 the phone was killing us.\u201d\r\n-  \u201c70% of my business comes through the phone. That\u2019s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.\u201d\r\n- \u201cBefore Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day\u2026. now my printer just stays printing!\u201d\r\n-  \u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 38 years. I\u2019ve been waiting for this since then.\u201d\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem \u2014 one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we\u2019re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don\u2019t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system\u2014where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed.

Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, including the critical stack-up paths,  applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\r\n\r\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26:\r\n\u2022 Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can\u2019t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued.

      "description": "Floot lets non-coders & entrepreneurs build real web apps that actually work. We\u2019re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI. Since June, 3000+ users have created over 4000 apps on Floot.\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don\u2019t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution. ",

Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our micro-guided missile system is man-portable, multi-domain capable, and has both forward-deployed and low-collateral defeat variants. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued a PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nA UAS prototype was designed and built in one week and a prototype of the guided missile was prototyped in four days. Following the Stanford Hacking for Defense process that Perseus Defense adviser and former Army Ranger Dr. Jeff Decker wrote the book on, Jason and Steve used 60 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. Perseus has already been invited to a Phase-II in-person pitch of their solution to government end-users, signaling progress towards contract opportunities. ",

So that's exactly what we're helping companies achieve; we started building a few weeks ago and are working with our design partner to get deep observability and insights into their agent executions.\r\n\r\nThe future is autonomous; AI agents will be everywhere. Mohi can make sure that we humans know what these agents are doing.",

One symptom among many: they waste hours retyping orders and invoices that arrive through scattered channels like WhatsApp, SMS, and email into their ERPs. Manual admin work takes over. Headcount grows just to handle repetitive tasks.\r\nThis leads to mistakes, tight margins, and food waste.\r\n\r\nStockline replaces outdated ERPs with AI at its core. The game-changer? No more manual data entry. Our AI pulls orders from every channel and feeds them directly into one unified system.\r\n\r\nAdmin disappears. Wholesalers get to focus on what really matters: their products and their customers.",

De-duping is a chore. Related issues get filed twenty times under different teams. The result: teams spend hundreds of hours just figuring out what the most important items are, before they can even start fixing them.\r\n\r\nJanet AI is the AI-native ticket triage and management layer for Jira.\r\n\r\nJanet AI watches every incoming ticket and immediately compares it to everything that\u2019s come before. It builds a knowledge graph: which tickets look like the same underlying bug, which roll up into the same component failure, which issues share the same root cause. With this, it surfaces duplicate or related issues, auto-detects fixes mentioned in these related tickets, and identifies those that matter most.\r\n\r\nBecause the data\u2019s structured, useful questions become instantly answerable using the Janet AI Chat Agent's contextual intelligence. \u201cWhat are the highest priority login bugs hitting enterprise customers running version X?\u201d \u201cHow should I fix issue PROJ-123?\u201d \u201cWhat are the most critical issues related to PROJ-456 and how should I prioritize these?\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral multi\u2011billion\u2011dollar enterprises are already in talks with Janet AI to reduce the manual work involved in managing tickets at scale.\r\n\r\nInterested?

We pinpoint exactly who needs attention and why, then recommend or autonomously take the right action to drive an expansion, prevent churn, and make sure no request falls through the cracks.\r\n\r\nTeam: \r\nSam (CEO): 2x founder. Led AI Product at Everlywell and early PM at Wonder (now valued at $7bn). Lived the pain of losing customer intimacy at scale and is obsessed with solving it. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nJack (CTO): Ex-SpaceX Flight Software Special Projects, where he developed telemetry routing and analysis systems for the most complex machines ever created. He\u2019s now doing the same for the complexities of customer relationships. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nAs B2B companies scale, the founder-level customer intimacy that drives early growth becomes impossible to maintain. Customer context that once fit in a founder's head scatters across systems, logs, and communication channels, drowning teams in noise no human can make sense of. Account managers juggling multiple customers become reactive firefighters, bleeding revenue through missed upsells and preventable churn. We've lived this pain and are building Ambral to help teams scale their most valuable asset: customer obsession.",
