      "description": "Magnetic scans client documents - from handwritten charity notes to excel spreadsheet Schedule Cs to multi-state K-1s - and enters them into tax software automatically, saving hours of tedious data entry. \r\n\r\nThe accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

With backgrounds in both enterprise engineering (Rheinmetall, dSPACE) and building web apps used by thousands, we have the unique blend of discipline and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nWe launched a hacky MVP two months ago and it exploded, growing to over 4,000 GitHub stars with massive viral attention on X and YouTube. Despite it being rough and experimental, we saw thousands of installations and currently have ~700 daily active users. This overwhelming market pull proves the desperation for a better solution. Our real moat is the custom, high-speed coding agent we are launching now - we expect this to dramatically increase growth and retention.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to empower anyone to create well-designed applications, regardless of their technical skill. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built. stagewise will enable non-technical stakeholders - product managers, designers, and marketers - to directly iterate on the UI themselves, creating a new, collaborative workflow and making us the essential tool for building on the web.",

Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our micro-guided missile system is man-portable, multi-domain capable, and has both forward-deployed and low-collateral defeat variants. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued a PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nA UAS prototype was designed and built in one week and a prototype of the guided missile was prototyped in four days. Following the Stanford Hacking for Defense process that Perseus Defense adviser and former Army Ranger Dr. Jeff Decker wrote the book on, Jason and Steve used 60 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. Perseus has already been invited to a Phase-II in-person pitch of their solution to government end-users, signaling progress towards contract opportunities. ",

With 100%+ annual turnover, hiring becomes a daily firefight of filling shifts with whoever shows up.\r\n\r\nWe use AI voice interviewers that run first-round phone screenings. But we don't stop at screening; our AI also monitors new hires through check-in calls during their critical first 90 days to detect early attrition signals and flag these for managers to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThis creates a learning loop. The screening AI gets smarter with each placement, learning to recognize which candidates will stick around versus those who will leave early. Over time, this means fewer bad hires and less turnover.\r\n\r\nThe result: managers stop wasting time on candidates who won't last, cost per hire drops as turnover decreases, and shifts get covered by people who actually want to be there.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.\r\n\r\nWe're not just screening candidates, we're redefining how retail businesses approach hiring and retention in high-turnover industries.",
