They\u2019re dashboards \u2014 not thinking tools.\r\n\r\nSo we built Scalar Field to change that: a platform where users can test any market hypothesis instantly using intelligent agents.\r\n\r\nYou can spin up agents that react to market events, run backtests across data from multiple asset classes, and even trigger trades when specific conditions are met \u2014 all in one place.",

Ayna and Andy, the co-founders, met during their time at Harvard and started this in 2024 as their programs were wrapping up. We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams. We already have two paying customers in the OEM and system integrator spaces. \r\n\r\nWe are venture backed and supported by a GBP 2.5MM grant by ARIA, the UK Government's invention agency. ",

We\u2019re not a generic annotation vendor\u2014we\u2019re your on-demand evaluation and safety data engine. In under a minute, you can spin up your own data-annotation workspace tailored to your workflow, so your team can move from \u201cwe think it works\u201d to measurable, repeatable results. \r\n\r\nModern AI changes quickly. Models evolve, prompts shift, and new edge cases appear the moment you go live. Besimple is built for that reality. Our platform generates task-specific annotation experiences aligned to your data and goals, so you can capture reliable judgment on everything from factuality and safety to preference and policy compliance. The result is an always-current evaluation loop that keeps pace with your product, rather than a one-off test that goes stale. \r\n\r\nWe specialize in evaluation and expert-grade safety data\u2014not commodity labeling. That means we recruit and train domain experts and SMEs to judge model outputs against high bars, and we design the interfaces and guidelines to make those judgments consistent, auditable, and useful for both offline evals and production monitoring. \r\n\r\nYour team shouldn\u2019t be waiting on back-and-forth specs and custom tooling. With Besimple, you can paste or stream your data, click to generate a tailored interface, and start collecting ground truth right away. When the task changes, the UI adapts with it. \r\n\r\nWe combine pragmatic product design with a human-in-the-loop operating model. Besimple helps you create clear, actionable guidelines and then enforces them with workflow guardrails, reviewer consensus, and targeted spot-checks\u2014so you can trust the numbers you ship. Because we\u2019re built for iterative work, teams can quickly compare prompts, models, and policies; spot regressions; and push fixes backed by fresh, expert-reviewed data. \r\n\r\nGreat models don\u2019t happen by accident\u2014they\u2019re the product of tight feedback loops, expert judgment, and tooling that bends to your data, not the other way around. If you\u2019re ready to replace slow, one-size-fits-all processes with a purpose-built evaluation and safety engine, Besimple gives you the fastest path from raw data to reliable decisions\u2014so you can iterate boldly and ship with confidence.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn\u2019t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don\u2019t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA\u2019s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil\u2019s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don\u2019t log your queries.\u201d Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user \u2014 not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it\u2019s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating \u201cGod in a box\u201d, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can\u2019t spy.",

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

      "description": "Post-acute agencies lose up to 15% of revenue each year to denials, non-compliant documentation, and delayed payments. Most treat it as a cost of doing business. Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals\u2014before revenue is lost.\r\n\r\nWhile working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes\u2014using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\r\n\r\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla\u2019s former CFO.\r\n\r\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\r\n\r\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that\u2014starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.",

We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. \r\n\r\nWe founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\r\n\r\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support \u2014 empowering patients to be an active part of their health team. We are a consumer app in beta testing and will be available on the App Store soon!",

A complete computing platform with:\r\n\r\n- all services for developers to fast-track deploying agents without reinventing the wheel \u2014 like framework-agnostic serverless deployments, an AI gateway for model routing and fallback, and custom MCP server hosting.\r\n- a flexible low-level API for builders to ship really performant agentic AI using our backbone infrastructure \u2014 using services like sandboxed VMs usable by agents, a programmable global gateway, and a 20ms-latency serverless compute engine.\r\n- and a seamless developper experience that integrates with their CI/CD, and APIs that can even be consumed by agents themselves!",
