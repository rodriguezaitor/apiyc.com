All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams.

Yet, many teams still use outdated tools or spreadsheets that aren\u2019t built for complex data from LLMs and AI agents. This slows down iteration, drives up costs, and makes model performance unpredictable in real-world use.\r\n\r\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly.  Simply paste or stream any type of raw data\u2014text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs\u2014and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow.  Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.\r\n\r\nKey differentiators\r\n1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.\r\n2. Tailored guidelines \u2013 Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\r\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation \u2013 AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.\r\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment \u2013 On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple\u2019s vetted annotators.\r\n5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins\u2014just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you\u2019re good to go.\r\n\r\nToday we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more.  For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\r\n\r\nBesimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta\u2019s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data \u2014or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail\u2014let\u2019s talk. We\u2019ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn\u2019t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don\u2019t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA\u2019s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil\u2019s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don\u2019t log your queries.\u201d Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user \u2014 not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it\u2019s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating \u201cGod in a box\u201d, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can\u2019t spy.",

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals\u2014before revenue is lost.\r\n\r\nWhile working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes\u2014using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\r\n\r\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla\u2019s former CFO.\r\n\r\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\r\n\r\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that\u2014starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.",

We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. \r\n\r\nWe founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\r\n\r\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support \u2014 empowering patients to be an active part of their health team.
