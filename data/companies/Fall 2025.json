Our system enables voice agents, copilots, and chat interfaces to retrieve, reason, and respond in sub-10 ms, delivering the responsiveness that makes AI interactions feel truly natural.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever built a conversational or voice AI product, you\u2019ve felt the lag. That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding. Moss is already powering production pilots across voice AI and developer platforms, achieving sub-10 ms retrieval and 70\u201390% token savings compared to traditional pipelines.",

Brands simply connect Boom to their store, and their AI agent instantly starts selling, supporting, and following up like a real team member \u2014 no setup or flow-building required.\r\n\r\nE-commerce is a $6T market where brands spend heavily to bring customers in, only to lose over 99% of them before checkout. Boom fixes that by turning every missed conversation into a sales opportunity. Our clients increase conversion rates and deliver a concierge-like buying experience at scale.

We\u2019re used by thousands of engineers in some of the largest companies in the world, including NVIDIA, Red Hat, Wikimedia, and Arista Networks.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding code, not writing it, is the primary bottleneck for large engineering teams. For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe met a decade ago at McGill University and have been building together full time for over 2 years. We\u2019ve personally felt the pain of understanding large codebases while working at Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, Google, and Meta.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

Think of Flick as Figma for AI filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 complete AI short films created using Flick that got 20+ awards in international film festivals already and our early creator residency community are generating several AI short films every week.\r\n\r\nWe are also building a community where we produce our own AI films as well as collaborating with other well-known filmmakers to share their \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d workflows as resuable templates to inspire users in our community. We not only build product, we also build world-class content.\r\n\r\nThe whole film industry will be revolutionized by AI and our goal is to be \u201cthe product\u201d that defines this category.",

It's a thinking partner that lets you instantly search your entire history of ideas, synthesize them into new insights, and watch your knowledge build on itself over time.\r\n\r\nRight now, your best thinking is trapped in ephemeral AI chat histories. Nessie unifies your context from ChatGPT, Claude, and (soon) Apple Notes/Google Docs/Notion/other context sources, auto-organizing the mess into an AI-enhanced brain.\r\n\r\nNext, we are unlocking sharing. Instead of sending a static doc, you will be able to send your \"Product Strategy Brain\" to a cofounder, or publish your \"Research Brain\" for your entire team to chat with.\r\n\r\nWho it's for: AI-native thinkers\u2014founders, researchers, and writers\u2014who believe their best ideas should compound.\r\n\r\nThe Team: We are two Yale CS grads and former Amazon engineers building the tool we needed for ourselves. We combine Anna's obsession with neuroscience and augmenting human cognition with Tiger's lifelong passion for building products (he shipped an app with 70k+ users at age 13).\r\n\r\nTraction: Launched 3 weeks ago. We have over 1,200 users who have imported 300,000+ AI conversations into Nessie. 30% week-over-week organic user growth.\r\n\r\nOrigin Story: Nessie was born after we hit the 1-million-token limit in multiple Gemini chats. Overnight, months of research disappeared. We realized the problem wasn't just about storage; it was that the medium for AI-native thought didn't exist yet. The chat window is a place to ask questions, not a place to build a mind.\r\n\r\nOur Vision: We are building a new medium for personal intelligence. Everyone will have an AI brain on Nessie. You will use it to think better, remember more, and share your mind with the world.",

We ingest unstructured deal materials and automatically turn them into clean, auditable Excel models. Analysts can go from raw documents to a working underwriting model in minutes instead of rebuilding spreadsheets cell by cell.\r\n\r\nAlt-X extracts and maps key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, leverage, and cap rate directly into Excel, then generates institutional-grade models, sensitivities, and IC-ready outputs that remain fully editable and transparent.\r\n\r\nTeams using Alt-X reduce deal evaluation timelines by up to 70%, save 30\u201350 analyst hours per deal, and screen 4\u00d7 more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating extraction, modeling, and error detection inside Excel, Alt-X turns underwriting from a manual bottleneck into a scalable workflow.\r\n\r\nOur first wedge is real estate and private equity, where Excel underwriting is slowest and most painful. We\u2019re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200M in assets. Alt-X is priced as a SaaS product starting at $30/month, with higher tiers for teams and advanced workflows.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: over $1.4T in private-market deals are underwritten globally each year, with $25\u201330B spent on diligence and analytics \u2014 nearly all of it manual and Excel-based.

Your spreadsheet is always wrong. You make expensive mistakes because this isn't your full-time job.\r\n\r\nHire a financial advisor: They'll manage your money and charge 1-2% of assets annually. Run that math over multiple decades and you're handing over half your net worth to fees.\r\n\r\nNeither path can economically deliver the sophisticated, personalized strategies the ultra-wealthy use to compound wealth: strategic tax-loss harvesting across individual securities, systematic risk management, portfolio-backed borrowing to defer capital gains, access to alternatives, etc.\r\n\r\nThese aren't secret \u2013 they're just economically impossible to deliver at scale through traditional human advisors.\r\n\r\nRobos were supposed to fix this, but they were designed in a pre-AI world. In practice they just manage cookie-cutter portfolios. They don\u2019t coordinate across your 401(k), taxable accounts, mortgage, equity, and cash flow, they don\u2019t help with real decisions like job offers, windfalls, or concentrated stock, and they don\u2019t deliver institutional strategies. That\u2019s why, even after a decade plus, the biggest robos are still <$100B AUM while old-school advisors like Raymond James / Edward Jones sit on trillions.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re doing for financial advising what Robinhood did for brokerages. Think of it as a full-stack, AI-native wealth strategist that brings billionaire-style playbooks to ordinary investors.\r\n\r\nAutonomous is built around a frontier-scale reasoning engine\u2014an AI that perceives global events as they unfold, understanding their deeper implications for markets and and most importantly, how these events will impact your investments.

      "description": "We build humanoid robots that do your chores at iPhone prices. Just like the millions of cars generating data for self-driving, we need millions of humanoids generating real-world data for general-purpose robotics. Humanoid companies today can only manufacture hundreds a year because motors are expensive and slow to assemble. We use artificial muscles. Each muscle is just a tube wrapped in braided fibre, and the whole robot is powered by a single pump \u2014 which means we can mass-produce humanoids by the millions. Our design is built for that scale from day one and is cheap enough to enter billions of homes.",
