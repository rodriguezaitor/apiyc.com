      "description": "Imagine AI is a task-based agentic AI that becomes your company's Head of Content. For B2B service firms, this means turning your partners' expertise into a pipeline-generating machine. Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to write posts, our AI performs deep research to build a 100-page persona, captures their authentic voice, and automates content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher). The idea for Imagine AI came after a YC partner told us directly: founders and partners at B2B firms are experts at their jobs, but they consistently struggle to turn that expertise into effective marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched just 8 weeks ago and have already reached $14k in revenue from 30 paying users, including forward-thinking firms like Conduit (YC '24). The demand is clear, with a 250+ person waitlist. The results are even clearer: one of our first users recently landed a $5M deal that originated from a single post our AI created.\r\n\r\nWe are displacing the expensive, low-ROI agency model by building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company. \r\n\r\nTo see how we automate your pipeline, book a demo at https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost \r\n\r\nor connect with our CEO, Sky Yang, on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",
