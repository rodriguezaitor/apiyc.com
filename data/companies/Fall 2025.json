It's a bridge that lets product designers own any UI change to the software they work on. \r\n\r\nDesigners use Rivet today to shortcut painful design handoffs and just make any visual change themselves. This saves time for designers and engineers and makes it radically easier to build software with great design and taste. \r\n\r\nThis becomes the next design tool because it lets designers break out of static tools and prototype like frontend engineers.  Use real components from your existing codebase to design remarkably complex interactions, and then ship it yourself.  ",

We 10x developer and AI agent productivity by building the tools to wrangle code complexity at scale.\r\n\r\nSourcebot started as a code search tool that hit the front page of Hacker News. Since then, we\u2019ve built the first AI search that works across thousands of repos, gained 2.6k+ GitHub stars, and have been installed 80k+ times. Today, we\u2019re used by thousands of engineers in some of the largest companies in the world, including NVIDIA, Red Hat, Wikimedia, and Arista Networks.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding code, not writing it, is the primary bottleneck for large engineering teams. For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase. Being open source and self-hosted means we can reach the largest enterprises in ways others cannot.\r\n\r\nWe (Brendan and Michael) met a decade ago at McGill University, and have been building together full time for over 2 years.

For B2B service firms, this means turning your partners' expertise into a pipeline-generating machine. Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to write posts, our AI performs deep research to build a 100-page persona, captures their authentic voice, and automates content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher). The idea for Imagine AI came after a YC partner told us directly: founders and partners at B2B firms are experts at their jobs, but they consistently struggle to turn that expertise into effective marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched just 8 weeks ago and have already reached $14k in revenue from 30 paying users, including forward-thinking firms like Conduit (YC '24). The demand is clear, with a 250+ person waitlist. The results are even clearer: one of our first users recently landed a $5M deal that originated from a single post our AI created.\r\n\r\nWe are displacing the expensive, low-ROI agency model by building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company. \r\n\r\nTo see how we automate your pipeline, book a demo at https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost \r\n\r\nor connect with our CEO, Sky Yang, on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",

That's why we built Multifactor.\r\n\r\nMultifactor offers best-in-class authentication, authorization, and auditing technologies for agentic systems, allowing users to securely and revocably share online accounts with agents while maintaining fine-grained permissions and a detailed event history. We are doing for AI security what Cloudflare did for web security, Okta did for identity security, and Wiz did for cloud security: defining the category.\r\n\r\nA world-class \"account manager\" that allows agents to securely use online accounts on your behalf is just the start\u2014our early enterprise partners include companies using AI agents to manage $7.5+ billion manufacturing supply chains, where the consequences for lapses in security are severe. Our patented AI security technology seamlessly integrates with existing agentic software to thwart attacks like prompt injection, so CISOs and end users alike can breathe a sigh of relief, without slowing the pace of AI adoption.",
