It's a bridge that lets product designers own any UI change to the software they work on. \r\n\r\nDesigners use Rivet today to shortcut painful design handoffs and just make any visual change themselves. This saves time for designers and engineers and makes it radically easier to build software with great design and taste. \r\n\r\nThis becomes the next design tool because it lets designers break out of static tools and prototype like frontend engineers.  Use real components from your existing codebase to design remarkably complex interactions, and then ship it yourself.  ",

It answers product questions, supports customers with orders, follows up on abandoned checkouts, restocks, and repeat purchases, and even runs marketing campaigns. Brands simply connect Boom to their store, and their AI agent instantly starts selling, supporting, and following up like a real team member \u2014 no setup or flow-building required.\r\n\r\nE-commerce is a $6T market where brands spend heavily to bring customers in, only to lose over 99% of them before checkout. Boom fixes that by turning every missed conversation into a sales opportunity. Our clients increase conversion rates and deliver a concierge-like buying experience at scale. We believe that in the near future, every online store will have AI employees managing sales and customer relationships \u2014 and Boom is building the platform that makes that possible.",

Most people don\u2019t realize how much craft that takes \u2014 so most AI ads end up looking like slop.\r\n\r\nAbsurd replaces that process with autonomous AI agents, guided by a team of creative directors, to create production-quality videos in 72 hours. These agents collaborate with your team on Slack to plan, script, and generate every scene on an interactive canvas.

We\u2019re used by thousands of engineers in some of the largest companies in the world, including NVIDIA, Red Hat, Wikimedia, and Arista Networks.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding code, not writing it, is the primary bottleneck for large engineering teams. For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe (Brendan and Michael) met a decade ago at McGill University, and have been building together full time for over 2 years. We\u2019ve personally felt the pain of understanding large codebases while working at Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, Google, and Meta.",

Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this). The idea came after a YC partner told us: founders at B2B companies are experts at their jobs, but consistently struggle to turn that expertise into marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched in mid-July, now serve 30+ paying customers including 14 YC companies (Conduit W24, Prism X25, Freya AI S25, Strac W22, Hyperspell F25) plus VCs, global franchises, and ghostwriting agencies.

For the first time, children and parents have complete control of the media they consume.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re harnessing brand-new video gen technology that\u2019s set to revolutionize how the world creates and learns. Generating animated, narrative-consistent content from a child\u2019s input in real time demands breakthroughs in generative AI, safety, and personalization \u2013 and Pixley has cracked it.\r\n\r\nThe market opportunity is massive. Families already spend billions on streaming and educational media, but the content is one-size-fits-all. By giving kids a true voice in what they watch, while giving parents control, Pixley makes early education personal, fun, and effective.\r\n\r\nWe are college dropouts that have been building together for years, winning several hackathons and working with video gen along the way. We built Pixley after we saw the flood of low-quality, algorithmic AI content and knew that kids and parents deserved better.  ",

The science is complex, the data is sparse, and most existing solutions are either too generic or too narrow to deliver meaningful insights. Women are left navigating life-altering symptoms with little guidance and few tools built specifically for them. Play Health changes that. We combine personalized tracking, at-home hormone testing, and AI-driven analytics to deliver actionable, data-first insights, and build the most advanced longitudinal dataset in perimenopause to date. This unlocks improved health today and enables the discovery of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and standards of care for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nPlay Health is led by successful, second-time, YC founders Andrea Mazzocchi and Ian Miller, with an exit and a unicorn between them.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

They struggle to comprehend 25-50% of them, forget 70% within 24 hours and 90% within a week, and have no way to learn and improve from their conversations.\r\n\r\nAR glasses are the only form factor that can augment conversations without disrupting them.
