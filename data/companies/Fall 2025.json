Our system enables voice agents, copilots, and chat interfaces to retrieve, reason, and respond in sub-10 ms, delivering the responsiveness that makes AI interactions feel truly natural.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever built a conversational or voice AI product, you\u2019ve felt the lag. That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding. Moss is already powering production pilots across voice AI and developer platforms, achieving sub-10 ms retrieval and 70\u201390% token savings compared to traditional pipelines.",

Every step is captured in a timestamped audit trail. Agents also enable continuous compliance: risk checks run as data changes. Reviews are prompted automatically. Nothing falls through the cracks.\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nNimit Maru, CEO \u2013 2X YC Founder.  Built and sold Fullstack (S12) for $55M on $1M raised. Experienced the trust industry's dysfunction firsthand post-exit and came back to YC to fix it.\r\n\r\nRush Sadiwala, COO \u2013 Experienced founder, previously backed by Kevin Rose at True Ventures. Spent the first 5 years of his career on the buy side in Investment Management. \r\n\r\nWe're in YC F25 and working with experienced trust professionals, including a Chief Trust Officer from a top-tier trust company, to bring modern infrastructure to the trust industry.",

We think of Lua as an agentOS that abstracts all of the complexity required to launch enterprise grade agents and combine it with the tools needed for these agents to succeed in the real world.\r\n\r\nLua was founded by Lorcan O Cathain (CEO) and Stefan Kruger (CTO)- experienced founders who have spent 15 - 20 years each scaling technology companies across emerging markets.\r\n\r\nWe sell to mid-market enterprises and developer agencies in the US and internationally. Developers are increasingly our primary ICP but we run SMB & enterprise sales motions to accelerate our learnings and further develop our product:\r\n- SMB ($25- 1k per month): fully automated self-serve agents that handle sales and support for eCommerce companies, hotels, restaurants and general service businesses. If you\u2019ve been on our website you\u2019ve likely seen this.\r\n- Enterprise: We directly sell to mid-market (~ $50M- $1BN) businesses across the US and internationally to eat our own dog food and strengthen our platform.\r\n",

For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe met a decade ago at McGill University and have been building together full time for over 2 years.

Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this).

They're all racing to be more autonomous, running for hours without human input.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work for real production code. When agents run autonomously, they make countless small decisions that pile up in your codebase. Engineers lose ownership - they don't know what was implemented, can't effectively debug or maintain it, and struggle to build on top of it. The code becomes a black box, and they're forced to throw it away.\r\n\r\nCompyle keeps engineers in the driver's seat.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

Analysts spend hours parsing PDFs and spreadsheets just to understand what a company or property is worth.\r\n\r\nAlt-X is building the data and AI infrastructure layer for alternative assets \u2014 a system that ingests unstructured deal materials, normalizes the data, and generates institutional-grade analysis in seconds. Whether it\u2019s a private-company dataroom or a real-estate offering memorandum, Alt-X extracts key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, and cap rate, then produces investor-ready dashboards and reports automatically.\r\n\r\nOur platform reduces deal evaluation timelines by up to 73%, saves 30\u201350 analyst hours per deal, and enables teams to screen 4\u00d7 more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating KPI extraction, benchmarking, and underwriting, Alt-X transforms diligence from a manual bottleneck into a scalable process.\r\n\r\nThis hasn\u2019t been done at scale because private-market data is fragmented across formats and asset classes. Alt-X\u2019s parsing engine unifies this chaos into a structured schema \u2014 the backbone for cross-asset underwriting, KPI dashboards, and automated risk scoring.\r\n\r\nOur first wedge is real estate and private equity, where underwriting is slowest and most manual. We\u2019re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200 million in assets, paying $1K\u2013$5K per month to automate deal screening and valuation.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: over $1.4 trillion in new private-equity and real-estate deals are underwritten globally each year, with $25\u201330 billion spent on diligence and analytics. Yet over 90% of this still happens manually. Alt-X\u2019s mission is to become the operating system for private-market investing \u2014 the Bloomberg Terminal of the AI era.",
