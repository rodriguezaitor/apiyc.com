For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that\u2019s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Founded by the creator of Zenter (YC 07, acquired by Google and became Google Slides), OrgOrg is designed to be a natural extension of Google Workspace Apps to help run organizations collaborate better leading to higher productivity.\r\n\r\nToday the suite includes apps like:\r\n  \r\n\u2022 Go links: Go links allows anyone in the org to easily name any link so team members can jump directly to the information that matters most: go/sales, go/production, go/anything-you-want.\r\n\u2022 Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\r\n\u2022 Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\r\n\u2022 Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\r\n\u2022 All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\r\n\u2022 Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\r\n\u2022 On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\r\n\u2022 And more...\r\n\r\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.\r\n\r\nBy selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of \u2014 things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire \u2014 imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. \r\n\r\nThousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned. \r\n",

They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. \r\n\r\nHowever, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.\r\n\r\nMica\u2019s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.\r\n\r\nSales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead.

Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before.

We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance\u2014all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had\u2014an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. Our mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.\r\n\r\nFinsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business \u2013 we are changing that.",

      "description": "The rise of weaponized drones has fundamentally transformed security threats both in warfare and civilian contexts. In Ukraine, $500 modified commercial drones regularly neutralize million-dollar military assets. At our southern border, cartels use drones to smuggle fentanyl and survey law enforcement positions. Critical infrastructure, military bases, and correctional facilities face unprecedented vulnerability to unauthorized surveillance and drone-based attacks.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2024, GuardianRF develops advanced RF spectrum sensors to protect against this evolving threat landscape. Our technology has been battle-tested in Ukraine, where consumer drones converted into precise guided missiles have become a daily reality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on regulatory compliance, our sensors can detect modified and non-Remote ID compliant drones from up to 3 km away, accurately pinpointing both drone and operator locations.\r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart is our distributed mesh network of sensors combining advanced Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology with AI-driven signal classification. Trained on extensive combat zone datasets, our system processes RF signatures in real-time across multiple frequency bands, catching even sophisticated stealth drones using frequency-hopping protocols. When a threat is detected, the system delivers precise targeting data while maintaining continuous tracking.\r\n\r\nOur product line includes:\r\n- Scout Detector: A handheld drone detector for rapid deployment and portability\r\n- Mosaic Sensor Network: A scalable mesh network of RF sensors for detecting, tracking, and mapping drone activity across expansive areas\r\n\r\nThe stakes are severe: along our borders, cartel drones facilitate trafficking that costs thousands of lives annually. In prisons, a single successful drone contraband delivery can trigger facility-wide violence. For critical infrastructure, a coordinated drone strike could cause billions in business interruption losses. Traditional drone defense systems, often priced in the millions, are cost-prohibitive for most organizations.\r\n\r\nGuardianRF bridges this critical gap with accessible, effective protection. Our AI classification engine recognizes various control protocols including modified ExpressLRS, Crossfire, and DJI variants, providing early warning of threats that traditional systems miss entirely. The system's fully automated detection, tracking, and response mechanisms ensure continuous protection with minimal operational overhead.\r\n\r\nBuilt and manufactured in the United States, GuardianRF combines field-proven technology with real-world deployment experience to counter modern drone threats. Whether safeguarding critical infrastructure, securing borders, or supporting defense operations, our systems deliver the comprehensive drone detection capabilities needed for today's security challenges.",

Thunder Compute is building technology to increase GPU utilization from 15-20% to 90%+, meaning that each GPU can be shared by 5x as many developers as in data centers today. Our technology achieves this efficiency gain by allowing all of the servers in a data center to share a single pool of network-attached GPUs rather than physically attaching a GPU to each server.

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can\u2019t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.\r\n\r\nWhile a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. \r\n\r\nTo change that, we\u2019re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re world class microbial engineers.

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

      "description": "With AI increasingly automating away code generation, software engineers will spend more time reading, judging, and architecting code rather than writing it. Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage\u2019s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren\u2019t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

The global market for airport baggage handling systems is $20+ billion and growing, presenting a significant opportunity for innovation and market disruption in this sector.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassenger air traffic volume is increasing, driving demand for efficient and reliable baggage handling at airports and putting immense pressure on existing infrastructure. In 2023 alone, airports processed approximately 4.5 billion bags, highlighting the need for advanced solutions to manage this load effectively. Azalea Robotics provides state-of-the-art robotic systems that enhance efficiency, reduce mishandling, and improve passenger experience through more reliable operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaggage handling is a critical component of airline ground operations, yet it is fraught with challenges. The work is physically demanding, often leading to long-term injuries among workers. Traditional baggage handling involves repetitive lifting and maneuvering of heavy loads, which can result in long-term health issues. Azalea Robotics addresses these challenges by automating the most strenuous tasks, thereby reducing the risk of injury and enhancing operational efficiency.",
