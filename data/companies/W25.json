      "description": "We are building an autonomous robot to precisely eliminate weeds and leave crops untouched. Despite $100 billion being spent annually on weed control, weeds still cost the US economy $46B/year. Weeds steal sunlight and nutrients from crops, forcing farmers to choose between higher costs and lower yields. Moreover, many farms still rely on hand labor to control weed growth. The process is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult due to constant labor shortages (1 out of every 5 US farm positions go unfilled each year). Our robot nicknamed the Field Hand is able to automate one of the worst jobs on a farm and will help healthily feed the world. ",

Isabelle worked at Figma and Notion, learning about the struggles of getting users to effectively use powerful yet complex products as well as GTM strategies to reach them.\r\n\r\nAt every step of the conversion funnel, users and companies struggle with knowledge gaps. Users not knowing how a product helps them reduces conversion, activation and retention. Companies not knowing what users want misleads messaging, product, and re-engaging churned leads. \r\n\r\nAI can do more than just replace a single job or industry. With Cedar at the center, we reimagine growth and customer support entirely, provide qualitative analytics of the user\u2019s story and using them to improve user\u2019s experiences live. As we enter the age of AI agents, they too will need an understanding of what software does and how to execute it. We plan to be the front door for all of them.",

Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint\u2019s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",

Companies like Anthropic are using Artificial Societies to predict how their marketing and content will perform in a simulation of their target customers, before launching in the real world. \r\n\r\nThis is a cracked team: James left rural China at age 14, got into Cambridge, turned down a CS PhD to do startups, and - in his spare time - lead the largest ever study of an LLM society. James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\r\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as \u201cWave\u201d, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies. Our vision is a world where all content, products, and policies are first simulated in an Artificial Society.

Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\r\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $170B on transportation capital projects, with an estimated 10-15% of that cost going to planning and consultants. This represents an ~$20B market opportunity in the US alone.

Sophris takes it further, analyzing specs and cross-referencing design requirements from multiple sources. As a result, subtle pin misconfigurations, voltage mismatches, and datasheet-specific quirks that typical rule checks might miss are brought to light.\r\n\r\nBy identifying design flaws during the schematic phase, Sophris helps you iterate confidently and deliver more reliable products. Faster turnarounds, fewer production surprises, and a smoother path from concept to manufacturing. With Sophris, design more confidently and ship more reliably.",

      "description": "careCycle is an AI workforce for medicare agencies and FMOs - helping leading agencies achieve 5x higher conversions, 37% better retention, and saving thousands of agent hours.\r\n\r\nWe're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.\r\n\r\nUsers have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\r\n\r\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.\r\n\r\nManufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. \r\n\r\nCompliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there\u2019s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there\u2019s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce. We\u2019re on a mission to solve this by building the first AI native software for the shop floor.

Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials \u2013 unlike fission \u2013 we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy.

In the functions where agents aren\u2019t yet intelligent enough to replace humans, they will be soon.\r\n\r\nWhen every human function required to operate a software product has an AI agent equivalent, the next step will be within reach: operating an entire company with a team of AI agents instead of humans.\r\n\r\nBut superintelligent agents within each function won\u2019t be enough. To operate a software company with 0 human employees, the agents will need to be directed towards common goals, integrated to collaborate across functions, tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics, and trained to make resource allocation decisions.\r\n\r\nWe are creating the tools needed to replace the entire org chart of a software company with a team of AI agents. We are developing these tools by owning the products that we automate, because we know from 10+ years of experience building automated systems with AI/ML that integration is the key to unlocking superhuman performance.",

In the years that we\u2019ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they\u2019ve been in decades.  \r\n\r\nAs fellows in Stanford\u2019s Center for National Security Innovation, we\u2019ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.\r\n",

Current approaches pursue single-gene fixes that only help small subsets of patients, leaving a multi-million patient population without effective treatment options.\r\n\r\n\r\nGene therapy opens the door to precisely modifying brain circuits. The problem is the elevated risk in neuroscience drug discovery. To solve this, we use a pre-clinical screening platform, multiple gene therapy candidates, and ML analytics to develop gene therapies capable of controlling neural activity and addressing neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\r\n\r\n",
