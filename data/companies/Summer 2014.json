We have developed a windshield protection film product line called ExoShield to help vehicle owners protect their windshields. Our ExoShield GT3 film is sold through 400+ aftermarket installers and car dealerships in 56 countries that carry and install it for vehicle owners. For Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco owners (google: broken windshield club), our ExoShield ULTRA DIY kits are available via our website and dropshipping partners. \r\n\r\nDefense - Over the last 3 years, we have been working with the Canadian Armed Forces to develop an infrared camouflage technology. We have received two contracts from CAF to develop our technology. Our solution has the ability to be integrated into the uniform directly (adding just 5-10g of weight vs. 600-18,000 kg of weight for other alternatives), has outperformed all existing NATO alternatives in multiple CAF field trials, and is receiving support from major elements of CAF for our next contract. This technology can also be adapted for other individual camouflage integrations (face paint and individual nettings) and for mobile camouflage applications (vehicle nettings and vehicle paints). ",

Earn some extra cash.\nLet backpack help you save that high shipping cost or earn a little extra.\n\nBackpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. \nEach backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.\nTravelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a \"backpack request\" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they \"request backpack\" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  \n\nbackpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.\nWhether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps. We would like to reject the counterfeits, we would like to reject the almost-originals, most importantly, we would like to not pay the heavy expense incurred, most of which we deem to be superfluous. Help us make a better, more original globalized world.",

We solve two core problems:\r\n \r\nFor consumers: Lawn Love is a modern, seamless lawn care experience. Gone are the days of physical, in-person estimates, payments left under the doormat, and spotty service. We use a combination of high-resolution satellite imagery, public and private data sets, and human review to generate a personalized quote for your yard \u2013 all in under two minutes and without ever setting foot on your property.\r\n \r\nFrom there, you are paired with a skilled lawn pro who will show up and complete the work. You can coordinate everything from your smartphone or web browser, and the entire experience is streamlined and delightful.\r\n \r\nFor lawn pros: We start by bringing a pipeline of new customers straight to your door. No more spending hours hanging door hangers or dealing with snake-oil SEO salespeople. Just pick up whatever jobs you want, fill out your schedule, and you\u2019re good to go. We also handle all the customer service, accounting, and collections; freeing you up to spend less time on the back-office work and more time in the field earning money. And that\u2019s just the start: Our advanced job clustering and routing algorithms help build you much denser routes, allowing you to do up to twice as many jobs per day while slashing your fuel expenses and idle time.\r\n \r\nIn short, we\u2019re democratizing software that was previously only available to large companies in the space, and giving small business owners tools to operate more efficiently and better compete with the big guys.",

While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.\r\n\r\nBig banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done?

By conducting online consultations via video chat, written journals, and even texting sessions, we have transformed traditional therapy into an experience that is low-cost, convenient, and completely confidential.\n\nEveryone can benefit from an objective perspective during difficult times, but the current model for supportive services is broken due to insurance gridlock, a clunky referral system, long wait times and unsustainable costs. Our web-based approach offers valuable guidance through accessible and anonymous means. Users log in to secure accounts and speak with licensed professionals on a variety of topics\u2014relationship conflict, job stress, etc.\u2014from anywhere at any time. With our proprietary technology, we have removed every barrier to entry and created an outlet for millions who wouldn\u2019t have sought emotional health services otherwise, reducing stress for an increasingly stressed-out generation. This is the future of mental health. \n\nThe shift in moving counseling services online is inevitable and our product is already in demand: After a successful pilot with Pretty Padded Room, an online therapy website specifically targeted towards millennial women, we are excited to relaunch as In Your Corner, an aspirational brand that provides the very best in counseling, coaching, and calm. In Your Corner improves on our original offering by being more gender-inclusive and convenient. In addition to developing a mobile app to provide one-tap, on-demand support in real time, users also have access not only to licensed mental health counselors, but also coaches in personal and professional development as well as instructors of meditation and breath work.",

      "description": "Neptune is an observability startup that offers one-stop incident enrichment and automation platform for IT Operations and DevOps teams.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of life that servers and applications go down causing IT outages. Today most of the IT incident response is manual, tedious and lengthy resulting in more downtime and losses for businesses. At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

We provide access to protein engineering, DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service. The best thing is that anything \"Powered by TAXA\" is designed to be free from expensive regulatory approval, meaning the products are available for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States immediately after they are developed. For a detailed list of the experiments which can be run on our platform please see the Services page.\r\n\r\nOur vision is a world where bio-engineering is as easy and commonplace as mobile application development is today. Game-changing technologies, like genetic engineering, should not be the exclusive preserve of large corporations and a wealthy elite. Democratizing the tools of creation enables anyone, anywhere, to genetically engineer plants and will unleash a wave of creativity to power an environment where ultimately what we create is limited only by our imagination.  The TAXA platform is our next step in the realization of that dream\r\n\r\nWe are also the team behind the first synthetic biology crowdfunding project, raising $484k on Kickstarter to make real glowing plants: www.glowingplant.com",
