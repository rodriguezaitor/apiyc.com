Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO\u00ae, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco\u2013based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

We have built highly optimized pharmacy stores and a set of internal tools designed to process prescriptions quickly.\r\n\r\nWe also provide easy-to-integrate APIs and SDK for anyone to start a virtual pharmacy without needing a license, pharmacy, or delivery fleet. Any doctor, teleconsultation app, or EMR provider can start delivering medicines to their patients on WhatsApp or App using our service in the background. We have more than 80 B2B partners, including India's top teleconsultation apps, EMR providers, hospitals, elderly care apps, and insurance providers.\r\n\r\nWe operate 24/7 in Gurgaon, New Delhi, and Moradabad and deliver over 15,000 orders monthly. So far, we have processed more than 250K orders and done thousands of life-saving deliveries.\r\n\r\nWe started in 2020 with the vision to build a centralized health record system for India. We had an AI-powered EMR app for doctors and a SaaS for diagnostic labs to add patients' medical records to Farmako Health ID. We have more than 3M health records added on Farmako. In 2022, the Indian government launched ABHA Health ID and we became one of the first official partners with them. In 2023, we launched quick medicine delivery and decided to move forward with ABHA Health ID for medical records.\r\n\r\nNow, we are building a safe health assistant inside our medicine delivery app, which will be connected to your Health ID and all your past medical records. Our goal is to make it a super-safe and accurate health assistant for the world, which can eliminate your doctor in the long run for all primary care issues.",

Despite distribution being a multi-trillion dollar industry, the legacy ERP systems that exist to help businesses manage their purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, ERP systems are painfully slow, difficult to use, and soul-crushingly manual. Using Recurrency can boost a distributor\u2019s revenue and profit margins, while reducing waste and saving time. Most importantly, Recurrency is fully integrated with the customer\u2019s legacy system, so deploying Recurrency in production can be done in as little as one day.",

      "description": "Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system \ud83d\ude9b \ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf31.\r\n\r\nToday, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. \r\n\r\nWith this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. \r\n\r\nOur product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. \r\n\r\nThe company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We\u2019ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We\u2019re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).\r\n",

We're starting by targeting consumer use-cases, and our first one is VTubing: an emerging type of content where creators use computer-vision and motion capture to pilot 3D avatars as content creation tools.\r\n\r\nAvatar content (also known as VTubing) has broken into the multi-billion-view-per-month category on places like Twitch and YouTube. This has given a new group of people the power to tell stories and present themselves on their own terms online while also protecting their IRL identities.  Our goal is to build the largest platform tools for this new movement. We're now  the #1 US VTubing app on iOS. \r\n\r\nWe also recently announced our seed funding: we're backed by Amazon, Two Sigma Ventures, MakersFund, YCombinator, and other great investors.\r\n\r\nApp Store: https://hyper.online/download\r\nTechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/hyper-raises-3-6m-from-amazon-and-more-for-its-iphone-based-vtuber-friendly-avatar-platform/",
