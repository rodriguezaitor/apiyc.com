Reviewing large volumes of code slows devs down, and increases the chances of bugs slipping through.\r\n\r\nThat's why we're building mrge: an intelligent code review platform that helps devs merge PRs 40% faster.\r\n\r\nHow? \r\n- When you open a PR, mrge automatically reviews it. It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\r\n- You then jump into the mrge platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and mrge generates diagrams of architecture changes.",
