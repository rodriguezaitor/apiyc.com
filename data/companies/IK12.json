Even worse, they\u2019re often unaware of who needs help because some students are too shy to raise hands. Classkick is a free app that eliminates those roadblocks, showing teachers exactly what their students are doing and who has pressed \u201cI need help\u201d on a specific part of their assignment. \r\n\r\nRather than reinvent how students learn or how teachers teach, Classkick facilitates current classroom learning. In Classkick, every student's\u2019 handwriting, whether it\u2019s a 2nd grader drawing a picture or an 11th grader doing physics, appears live to the teacher in a mosaic of working students. The teacher can zoom into any student\u2019s sheet to help them and ask a probing question to redirect their thinking. By the time the student has read and thought through the feedback, the teacher has already swept off and helped 5 others.\r\n\r\nWe are hyper focused on one goal: increase student learning. To achieve this, we listen to educators to truly understand how technology can assist in the learning process.",
