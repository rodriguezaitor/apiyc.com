Founded by Chris (2x Founder; ex-CEO at Better Nature; Forbes 30U30) and Dirk (ex-Google Data, Analytics & AI Lead), we\u2019re backed by YC (W26).\r\n\r\nIn our first month full-time, we\u2019ve raised $1.6M and secured rapid commercial traction with 15 design partners and a growing pipeline of 30+ brands. Our mission is bold: give CPG brands completely hands-free supply chains that run themselves through Sarah, their AI ops assistant.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re now growing a small, world-class team of builders excited to reinvent how physical goods companies operate\u2014end-to-end, autonomous, and AI-first. If you want to work on hard problems, ship fast, and define the future of autonomous operations, you\u2019ll feel right at home here.\r\n",
