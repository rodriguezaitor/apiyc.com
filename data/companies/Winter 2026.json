Chasi\u2019s AI agents act as executive assistants for sales and support reps, automating follow-ups, data collection, status updates, and outreach so teams can spend more time with customers and less on admin.\r\n\r\nOver half of dealer payroll goes to sales and support, but a third of that team\u2019s time is lost to admin. Fleets still run under 60% utilization, most branches lack after-hours coverage, and the aftermarket is largely reactive. Chasi plugs these revenue leaks by keeping units rented or sold, chasing every lead, and driving the right parts and service before machines fail.",

Hlabs is making a plug-and-play ecosystem of robotic parts with simple opensource software libraries to reduce the complexity in building a robot.\r\n\r\nHlabs is founded by Paul, a second time YC founder who also participated in the W21 batch with Mystic. He ran Mystic as CEO for 6 years.\r\n\r\nFrom the first launch in October 2025 over 40 robotics companies have placed orders for the actuator control product. Hlabs is targeting Q1 '26 for the release of several additional plug-and-play products including an Nvidia Jetson powered main board, a low cost expandable camera system, and wireless communication/video module to make every robot wireless out of the box.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "As autonomy moves into complex safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation), failures become more costly and companies must devote significant in-house effort to validate their system before real-world deployment. Valgo accelerates autonomous systems development and certification by providing tooling to perform algorithmic safety validation at scale. We are building a platform to efficiently find rare and realistic failure events in simulation at a fraction of the compute cost required by existing approaches. Our tools are agnostic to models/simulators (i.e., black box) and can be applied across industries such as autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance.\r\n\r\nValgo was founded by Stanford PhDs who wrote the textbook and taught the course at Stanford on algorithmic safety validation. We also have significant industry experience working on an FAA-certified collision avoidance system at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, validating autonomous aircraft at Xwing, and collaborating with industry sponsors across transportation, aviation, and energy.",
