      "description": "Flutter is recreating the magic of seeing someone in real-life for the first time, on your phone.\n\nFlutter lets you record short, ephemeral videos to express yourself and capture the attention of potential matches nearby. Users browse through nearby videos and, just like Tinder, like or pass on each one before moving on to the next.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: to actually match with someone, you have to be on the app at the same time and look into each other\u2019s eyes for 15 seconds to see if there\u2019s a spark. We help users play this game by sending push notifications when people they like are online.\n\nVideo is so powerful. We've seen this with YouTube, Snapchat, Meerkat. And 15 seconds of live, two-way video can tell you so much more about a person than hand-picked photos and bios.",
