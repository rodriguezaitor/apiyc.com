It runs entirely in the cloud. This means that you can have swarms of agents completing hundreds of tasks while you\u2019re focusing on what really matters.\r\n\r\nYou can connect Zero to the applications you use or your custom MCP servers, and then just give it any task and watch it work for you. Zero is engineered to think deeply, execute complex tasks, and even maintain a personalized memory of your interactions.\r\n\r\nA few notable features:\r\n- Built-in autonomy levels, permissions, guardrails, and human approvals\r\n- Custom instructions to teach Zero how to do things your way\r\n- Automations e.g. run a task every day or whenever I receive an email\r\n- Connect to your custom MCPs\r\n- Connect to 300+ apps with one-click integrations\r\n- Natively integrates deep research and browser use",

Our engineering copilot predicts and prevents machine failures in real time by solving problems the same way an engineer would.\r\n\r\nOur agents have access to and make sense of the structured and unstructured data that exists at factories including machine sensor data, maintenance manuals and work orders. Our simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal AI knowledge to create custom complex workflows on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts. We know that dashboards don't cut costs, actions do.",
