Covid and Brexit ceased the usual oversupply of candidates, making traditional job boards unable to meet employers' needs, and agencies more expensive than ever. As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we\u2019ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",

      "description": "\ud83d\udca1 What is Pandai?\r\n\r\nPandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. \r\n\r\nPandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd25 Why do we build this? \r\n\r\nIn Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. \r\n\r\nThere is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we\u2019ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude80 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

      "description": "Tenyks (YC S21) is a Cambridge University spin-out building the World's Most Versatile Visual Intelligence Platform\u2014think Snowflake for Vision or GPT for Video.\r\n\r\nProblem: Companies today collect oceans of visual data (from cameras, drones, and satellites), but struggle to extract actionable insights. Current solutions rely heavily on manual analysis by call centres in locations like the Philippines or AI platforms narrowly focused on security rather than deeper operational insights. This leaves critical improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth unrealised.\r\n\r\nSolution: Tenyks unlocks unprecedented insights by applying advanced multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of comprehensive video summarisation, retrieval, and visual question-answering. These VLMs are seamlessly combined with specialised analytics for emotion detection, activity recognition, object tracking, and even gait analysis. Our platform transforms ordinary visual footage into extraordinary operational intelligence.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus: Starting with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), we enable operations leaders to instantly understand customer flow, kitchen efficiency, staff productivity, and quality of service using their existing security camera footage\u2014turning previously inaccessible data into direct operational improvements and clear financial ROI. For instance, insights from Tenyks can accelerate the speed of service significantly; even a 1-second improvement in service speed could generate $30,000 additional annual revenue per restaurant. For a multi-unit owner of 100 restaurants, that's an additional $3 million per year.\r\n\r\nTraction: We've recently secured our first Fortune 500 customer, joining other major enterprises, global system integrators, and high-growth startups trusting Tenyks for powerful, data-driven decision-making.\r\n\r\nWhy Tenyks: Our patented technology originates from the founders' PhD research at Cambridge University. Previously, we helped world-leading teams scale high-performing Vision AI in production. \r\n\r\nRecognition: Recognised as a Rising Star in Gen AI by Sifted, Best Product of the Year by Vision AI Alliance, and Company of the Year by Cambridge University (previously awarded to DeepMind).",

For each property we set up the investment trust, find qualified co-owners, and handle the entire real estate purchase transaction. Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

Omnivore is faster, cheaper, and more practical than electric propulsion while being substantially less expensive, safer, and more operationally flexible than legacy chemical propulsion systems. Our Sutter Telescope System can identify and locate resource-rich asteroids and orbital debris that existing technologies can\u2019t find and works synergistically with our Worker Bee OTV for orbital logistics. For government customers, Sutter can identify dark fast-moving objects between Earth and the Moon which currently evade detection, a critical issue for national defense and a key need of the Space Force. We are already using Sutter in ground-based observatories and will begin commercial sales of Sutter SDA data next month having tracked dozens of faint moving objects in space already. Once launched into space, Sutter will be 300,000 times more cost effective than any other known telescope design and will revolutionize sense making in space.",

The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

      "description": "In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy\u2014a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.\r\n\r\nOur Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.\r\n\r\nImpact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.\r\n\r\nRecognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company\u2014it\u2019s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.\r\n ",

We\u2019re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd15 The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\n\u2705 Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI\u2019s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer\u2019s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

As it stands, the majority of delivery providers are still using pen and paper to manage delivery and fulfillment operations, leading to 5x the rate of failed deliveries and 3x the operating costs as compared to global benchmarks.\r\n\r\nAt ShipBlu, we've built an infrastructure that handles every aspect of delivery and fulfillment operations. We've also added some unique features that tie in various business functions, allowing us to realize significant efficiencies compared to other players. Our platform is managed by ShipBlu AutoPilot - our collection of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms that constantly make operational predictions and decisions to reduce costs, meet delivery constraints, and refine our operating assumptions. Designed by ShipBlu's CTO, Abdelrahman is currently completing his PhD at Brown University where he explores the applications of AI and ML in optimization problems.\r\n\r\nWe built a nationwide delivery network in Egypt in about 2.5 months, kicking off operations on Aug 1st, 2021. In under 4 weeks, we have signed on over 40 merchants, and when those merchants fully go live in October, we will be making over $40k in MRR.",

      "description": "At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone.\r\n\r\nAlmost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",

In order to mimic the organoleptic properties of chocolate (tender, smoothly melting taste release) we are working on the flavor itself but also on replacing the cocoa butter. \r\n\r\n55 Mio lbs of chocolate are consumed every day. By 2035 we will substitute a big chunk of it through our sustainable chocolate. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we are working on extending our technology platform to additional ingredients such as palm oil.\r\n",

To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases.

We do so by buying loans in small quantities at first and rewarding our customers with more access to capital based on performance. Co-founder & CEO, Vladimir Korshin, previously worked in the traditional venture debt system at Silicon Valley Bank, where he noticed that strong startups were frequently denied from non-dilutive financing because they were too small. Just 4 weeks after going live with our first customer, we purchased $1.3M in loans across 6 customers. The founding team brings 30+ years of startup experience: Vladimir previously worked as an operator at Facebook, Eventbrite, and Niantic; Asa Schachar was an engineer at Microsoft and managed teams of engineers at Optimizely; Molly Hogan led new and international product initiatives at Amazon for over 7 years. Level is backed by Liquid2, Y Combinator (S21), and others. https://www.trylevel.app/",

The convenience of supermarkets & 15-minute grocery apps comes at the expense of freshness: food that should be delivered fresh, gets bought in bulk and sits on warehouse shelves for days. To get the freshest produce, you need quick producer-to-end-customer delivery, not just quick warehouse-to-customer delivery. Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product. Membo's CEO, Vahur Hansen, was an early engineer at TransferWise, and co-founder, Paula Kink, built her own healthtech startup. Launched in Dec 2020, we've grown 30% MoM for the past 8 months and have delivered over 4000 orders in Tallinn, Estonia.",
